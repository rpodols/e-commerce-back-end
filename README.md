# E-cinnerce Back End - Challenge 13

## Description
This project is the thirteenth challenge of the coding bootcamp.

User Story: As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies, so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

Starting from minimal starter code, this challenge required writing additional code to do the following:
*   GIVEN a functional Express.js API
        -WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
        -THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

        -WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
        -THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

        -WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
        -THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

        -WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
        -THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

        -WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
        -THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
